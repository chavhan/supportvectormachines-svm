Support Vector Machines(SVM) algorithm demonstration

File Structure:
readme.txt
forest_analysis
forest_svm
salary_analysis
salary_svm
total_result

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
forest_svm-  file in R language covering objective of forestfire dataset
forest_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on forestfire dataset
salary_svm- file in R language covering objective of salary dataset
salary_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on salary dataset
total_result - It is an set of results of accuracy figure on company/fraud/iris dataset 



objective:- 
(1) classify the Size_Categorie using SVM. 
(2) Prepare a classification model using SVM for salary data. 

Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot dataset.
